{"name":"Zyklop","tagline":"Rsync wrapper making syncing easy","body":"==========\r\n Zyklop â—Ž\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis program is a wrapper around rsync. It will help you:\r\n\r\n    * if you need to sync files from remote server frequently\r\n    * No need to keep the location of the file in your mind. It finds\r\n      them for you.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n==============\r\n\r\n    * Python >= 2.6 (Python >= 2.7 for tests)\r\n    * rsync installed\r\n    * **locate** installed with up-to-date database on the remote system\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Steps\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIf you are new to ssh, setup an ssh configuration first. If you are\r\ndealing with a lot of servers, giving them an alias makes it easier to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n    #. Create an ssh configuration in your SSH home, e.g.::\r\n\r\n        vim ~/.ssh/config\r\n\r\n       You can use the following example as a starter::\r\n\r\n        Host spameggs\r\n        Hostname  12.112.11.122\r\n        Compression yes\r\n        CompressionLevel 9\r\n        User guido\r\n\r\n       but be sure to check the `documentation\r\n       <https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh+config+documentation&t=canonical>`_\r\n       or the man page (5) for `ssh_config`\r\n\r\n    #. Make the config only readable for the owner::\r\n\r\n        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config\r\n\r\n    #. Test if you can login to your configured host using only your\r\n       alias::\r\n\r\n        ssh spameggs\r\n\r\n    #. Test if locate works on the remote server by searching for a test\r\n       directory (here called `findmesomething`)::\r\n\r\n        locate findmesomething\r\n\r\n    #. Now you can copy/sync `findmesomething` with zyklop::\r\n\r\n        zyklop spameggs:findmesomething .\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\n\r\n    #. Syncing a ZODB from remote server configured in ``~/.ssh/config``\r\n       as spameggs. We choose not the first database, but the second::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop spameggs:Data.fs .\r\n        Use /opt/otherbuildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) n\r\n        Use /opt/buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) y\r\n\r\n    #. Syncing a directory providing a path segment::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop spameggs:buildout/var/filestorage$ .\r\n\r\n    #. Syncing a directory which ends with `blobstorage``, excluding any\r\n       other `blobstorage` directories with postfixes in the name (e.g.\r\n       `blobstorage.old`)::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop spameggs:blobstorage$ .\r\n\r\n    #. Use an **absolute path** if you know exactly where to copy from::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop spameggs:/tmp/Data.fs .\r\n\r\n    #. Syncing a directory which needs higher privileges. We use the\r\n       ``-s`` argument::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop -s spameggs:blobstorage$ .\r\n\r\n    #. **Dry run** prints out all found remote paths and just exits::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop -d spameggs:blobstorage$ .\r\n        /opt/otherbuildout/var/blobstorage\r\n        /opt/otherbuildout/var/blobstorage.old\r\n        /opt/buildout/var/blobstorag\r\n\r\n    #. Sync the first result zyklop finds automatically **without\r\n       prompting**::\r\n\r\n        $ zyklop -y spameggs:blobstorage$ .\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Problems\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nZyklop just hangs\r\n    This can be caused by paramiko and a not sufficient SSH setup. Make\r\n    sure you can login without problems by simply issuing a::\r\n\r\n        ssh myhost\r\n\r\n    If that does not solve your problem, try to provide an absolute path\r\n    from the source. Sometimes users don't have many privileges on the\r\n    remote server and the paramiko just waits for the output of a remote\r\n    command::\r\n\r\n        zyklop myhost:/path/to/file .\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n==========\r\n\r\nI'm dealing with Zope servers most of my time. Some of them have a\r\n*huge* Data.fs - an object oriented database. I do have in 99% of the\r\ncases an older version of the clients database on my PC. Copying the\r\nwhole database will take me ages. Using rsync and simply downloading a\r\nbinary patch makes updating my local database a quick thing.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, with zyklop I'd like to address two things:\r\n\r\n    1. Downloading large ZODBs takes a long time and\r\n       bandwidth. I simply don't want to wait that long and download that\r\n       much.\r\n    2. Most of the time I can not remember the exact path where the item\r\n       to copy is on the remote server.\r\n\r\nNon Goals\r\n---------\r\n\r\nZyklop is not:\r\n\r\n    * a Backup Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n====\r\n\r\n    * tty support: sometimes needed if SSH is configured to only allow\r\n      tty's to connect.\r\n    * Don't hang if only password auth is configured for SSH\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in hacking, clone zyklop on github:\r\n\r\n     https://github.com/romanofski/zyklop\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
