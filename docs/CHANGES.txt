CHANGES
=======

0.3 (2013-01-14)
----------------

    * Changed host, match parameters: Now you can specify the source
      host and path match in one parameter delimited by a column,
      similar to scp (e.g. foohost:/path)
    * Allow to provide an absolute path to the file you'd like to copy.

0.2 (2012-03-08)
----------------

    * Added basic support for using sudo in finding and syncing (rsync)
    * Added argparse as dependency as Python 2.6 won't have it
    * New positional argument to provide destination to copy
      file/directory
